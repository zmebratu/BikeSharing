# Bikesharing

## Objective
The mission of this analysis was to persuade investors to implement a much-needed bike sharing program in the city of Des Moines. In order to propose this great business plan, I had to convert the “tripduration” column within the Citi Bike file from an integer to a datetime datatype. From there the file was then used to create visuals in Tableau.

## Results

* In August there were 2,344,224 bikes used. A majority of those bikes were used for less than 10 minutes.

* Of those 2,344,224 bikes used, males were 3 times as likely than women to use the bikes for less than 10 minutes.

* In the graph above, we can conceptualize the amount of bike users by day and time. Most users range from Monday-Friday between the hours of 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm. On the weekends, we can see that Saturday has more users than Sunday. However, the day and time with the most users is Thursday at 6pm.

* In the image above, 6pm on Thursday seems to be the time slot with the most male and female users. As for the unknown gender, 12pm on Saturday appears to have the maximum amount of users.

* Here we can see that most birth years have an average trip duration of 800 minutes and those with a later birth year are more likely to have a longer ride.

* Most male and female users during the weekday are subscribers. While those with an unknown gender are mainly customers.

* Out of the total users in August, 1,900,359 are subscribers and 443,865 are customers.

## Summary
After conducting the analysis, investing in a bike program would be a very beneficial and profitable business. There are almost 2.4 million users already using Citi Bike. Most individuals use the bikes for commutes to and from work or for weekend trips. We can see there is a necessity for these bikes. 
To further my analysis, I would also research bike usage in other months. Are people using it less during the summer? Maybe the winter? Or is there a steady flow. In addition to this, I would determine how many bikes are need and what locations would be best for the customers.

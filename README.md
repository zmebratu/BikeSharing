# Bikesharing

## Purpose
The mission of this analysis was to persuade investors to implement a much-needed bike sharing program in the city of Des Moines. In order to propose this great business plan, I had to convert the “tripduration” column within the Citi Bike file from an integer to a datetime datatype. From there the file was then used to create visuals in Tableau.

## Results
In August there were 2,344,224 bikes used. A majority of those bikes were used for less than 6 minutes.
